# hello-world
My very first repository! Whatever that is . . .

I'm an early twenties white kid preoccupied with leaving the best world possible for following generations by working to bridge the gaps in communication and lifestyle and filling the voids with compassionate understanding. 
I reckon learning to program can help with that, at the very least by providing me the income to take direct actions when I believe they will be of benefit.
